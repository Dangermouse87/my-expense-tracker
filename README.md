# My Expense Tracker

##  Welcome everyone to my very first React.js app.

## I chose to do an expense tracker as it is something that is quite personal to me. As I still write down everything I spend in my notebook. 

## By building this app, I not only hope to show my progress in React, but I hope to make the app as dynamic and feature rich as possible so I will be able to share this with anyone who may wish to use the app.

## Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed using My Expense Tracker.
